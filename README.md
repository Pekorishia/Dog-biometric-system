## Taks List

- [x] Extract all metacarpal pads from the images
- [x] Write code to convert .jpg to .ppm
- [x] Write code to binarize a image given a threshold value
- [x] Write code to detect shapes and contours of the binarized images
- [x] Write code to generate a instance vector based on the representative point of the metacarpal pad
- [x] Write code to get all instances from all pads and calculate the knn based on their distance
- [x] Write code to get all the accuracy and true-positive results

- [x] After the results, enhance the contour extraction
- [ ] Re-extract the pads, but only the ones with a medium-high quality
- [ ] Enhance the Knn-algorithm
